1.1.2

(MEAT) The parties to this Agreement recognize the competitive nature of
the industry and therefore agree that no individual having or claiming to
have an proprietary interest in the firm of the signatory Employer under contract to Locals covered by this Agreement will be permitted to work hours different from those established by this Agreement; nor shall such individual be permitted otherwise to violate the spirit of any working conditions established by this Agreement.

Once an Employer becomes subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such Employer thereafter shall continue to be subject to such terms regardless of any change in the nature of the entity by voluntary action or by operation of law including specifically reorganization as a partnership or corporation or an lease arrangement and including specifically operations conducted by Receiver, Board of Trade, or similar procedure.

1.2

FOOD CLERK'S WORK: The work covered by this Agreement shall be performed only by members of the appropriate unit as defined in Section 1 hereof and such work shall consist of all work and services connected with or incidental to the handling or selling of all merchandise offered for sale to the public in the Employer’s retail food stores including the demonstration of such products, but excluding:

After any such assignment to members of the bargaining unit, the Employer may, at its discretion, return to the former practice of utilizing the services of such non-bargaining unit persons.

1.2.6

(Food and Meat) The parties hereby establish the following procedure for the purpose of ensuring an orderly environment for the exercise by the Employer's employees of their right under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act and to avoid picketing and/or other economic action directed at the Employer in the event the Union decides to conduct an organizing campaign at any operation at which the Union does not have representation rights.

The parties mutually recognize that national labor law guarantees employees the right to form or select any labor organization to act as the employees' exclusive bargaining representative for the purpose of collective bargaining with the Employer.

The Employer will take a neutral approach to unionization of employees. The Employer will not take action nor make any statement that will directly or indirectly state or imply any opposition by the employer to the selection by such employees of a collective bargaining agent.

Thereafter, the Employer will provide updated lists as requested. but no more frequently than monthly.

The Union may request recognition as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for the employees in the traditional bargaining unit represented by the Union in the food industry. A disinterested, neutral party mutually satisfactory to the Employer and the Union will be selected to conduct a confidential review of employees' authorization cards and membership information submitted by the Union in support of its claim to represent a majority of the employees in the unit if either the Union or Employer so request. If a majority of employees within the unit has joined the Union or designated it as their exclusive collective bargaining representative, the Employer will recognize the Union as such representative of the employees and will extend to such employees this Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Union and the Employer together with any amendments agreed to by the parties. The Employer will not file a petition with the National Labor Relations Board for an election in connection with any demands for recognition provided for in this Agreement.

During the life of this Agreement, the Union will not engage in picketing or other economic activity at an operation covered by this Section, provided that if the Employer recognizes any other Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of employees in the unit, or any part thereof. traditionally represented by the Union, this paragraph shall terminate immediately and without notice.

The parties agree that any disputes over compliance with or the application of this Section, including claims of Union violation, shall be submitted to expedited arbitration using the expedited arbitration process set forth in this Agreement.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to order the non-compliant party to comply with this Section and to order such other remedies deemed necessary to effectuate the intent of this Section. The parties hereto consent to the entry of any order of the arbitrator as the order of judgment of the United States District Court, without notice.
